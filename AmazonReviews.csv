R2IOYW8GNJDUAZ,G. W.,"So far I've only made it to ""for loops"" chapter 4; but I think this is a really good book. I had an online class from a local University and this book has covered somethings that the class did not. Not that what the book covered and the class didn't has been major; but is interesting that only having reached chapter 4 in the book that there are things the class left out. So far the biggest change between this book and the class I took is that the book does a much better job of explaining for loops. I even watched a video on Youtube to teach you Python with no experience and even that did not do as good a job of explaining why a for loop is written the way it is. Being that the class I took was online and was one of those classes done in half the time (warp speed) I didn't bother to ask why a for loop is written the way it is I just wrote it and followed the class examples (and yes I passed the class with an A but Python is not my first programming language). I feel way more confident in learning Python after the book did such a good job of explaining for loops that as I continue with the book I believe it will explain things better then the class I took or the video I watched. On a side note the class I took, as all college classes I have taken do, required a book and that book just didn't do a good job of explaining for loops (go figure). You might be wondering why am I using this book if I took an online class and the answer is it has been awhile since I took that class so I need a refresher. Also the college that I took that class from doesn't offer another a following Python class to take unless you sign up for a degree program (and I already have a degree I just want to become proficient in Python). I would recommend that if you want to learn Python to use in a job to take at least one class from a college or another way to get proof that you learned Python other than studying it on your own. Also another reason to learn from a book with no class attached to it is you can learn at your own pace. Now I could learn from the book that I bought for the college course since the class only went so far into the book; but I just didn't find that book to be very well written and full of information one doesn't really need to learn how to program with Python. I feel like a ""college"" course book has a lot of bloat while a book like this one is more straight forward. A book like this one survives and sells or not because it is good etc while a college course book is chosen by the teacher or school regardless of the reviews it got. So after this extremely long review I would recommend this book; but I think one does need something (a class, certificate etc) to show proof that one has at least some Python knowledge outside of ones own studying.","Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2021","Recommend getting, but also get proof of Python knowledge elsewhere (see below)",5.0 out of 5 stars,,19,
R3NY3KXV8N46K7,Owen C. Marshall,"With the lockdown from the global pandemic, I have been forced to work from home like many other people. Since my usual job involved supporting hardware, this meant I was going to be stuck! Fortunately, my boss said that if I could spend my time learning skills useful to the lab, I could count the hours doing that. I asked whether learning Python would count. I told him that I would try to create scripts to monitor my hardware from home. He said that was acceptable.

I have some programming experience, but it has been years since I coded, and then it was usually for relatively basic tasks in undergrad. I was looking for something that would not insult my intelligence, but that would still be interesting enough to keep me on task. So, after searching around I found this book. I saw the highly rated reviews. I skimmed the language that the author used in the sample. I read the table of contents and saw that the second part of the book consisted of creating games in order to solidify the skills learned.

Yes! This sounded perfect.

I have not been disappointed.

The book walks the reader through setting up (checking if Python is on the computer already, downloading it if necessary, using an IDE and what that is, etc). And then it moves on to the usual basic programming. The writing is clear. I had no problems with the examples and found the practice problems to be well chosen. I also liked the way that the author encouraged good practices such as documentation and testing.

I am currently in Part 2 of the book and have been working on the first project, a game called Alien Invasion which is basically a version of Space Invaders. I am definitely enjoying that. And I can see how some of the skills I learn from this could transfer over into monitoring my equipment. Reading files, taking user input, opening windows, drawing on the screen, making calculations, all of these things are necessary for the game, and for my own goals.

I personally never had any problems, but I also noticed that the author's website includes cheat sheets, solutions, and errata, not to mention the files suggested for the projects.

I am not sure if this book is for an absolute beginner. My experience is too far from that for me to be a good judge. But I can say that a person with basic programming knowledge and no prior knowledge of Python found it to be a great resource.","Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2020","Easy to Follow, Good Intro for Self Learner",5.0 out of 5 stars,,13,
R270DXU8YVGFPX,Umar,"In embarking on my journey to learn Python, I initially struggled with various online video courses and even subscribed to the paid version of Codecademy, only to find myself constantly backtracking. It wasn't until recently that I dusted off a book that had been sitting on my shelf for a couple of years.

This book turned out to be a hidden gem. The clarity and structure of the content are truly commendable. The author's approach to presenting Python concepts made it easy for me to build upon what I learned, creating a strong foundation that kept me motivated throughout the process. I feel the way the book is organized seemed to unlock a seamless progression in my understanding of Python that once I would get to the exercises in the end I was actually able to work through those myself or at least knew what I needed to google to clarify what I needed further elaboration with.

Whether you're delving into Python for professional reasons or simply as a personal endeavor, I wholeheartedly recommend this book.

R13Z1BSD70DMKJ,Dan,"Have had this for one day and the cover is already coming off. Nothing a little glue won’t fix, and that’s the downside of paperbacks that you have to put weight on to keep closed, in my opinion.

BUT the inner content is well worth it. I’ve been wanting to learn programming for years but have often gone away discouraged because the tutorials and teachers randomly start throwing complicated problems at you out of nowhere.

Not so with this book. It eases you into each topic, breaks it down very clearly, and has exercises throughout that you can follow along with. Make sure you follow along! There are specific exercises throughout, but I highly recommend typing out the example code and playing around with it/experimenting on your own as well. Then by the time you get to the exercises you’ll have a good idea about how to approach it.

STICK WITH IT! I decided I wanted to learn to program 10 years ago! I would start for a week and then quit when it got too complicated and felt overwhelming. Then I’d come back to it a few years later, and same thing. Then it hit me one day, “If I had pushed through the first time and been patient, I’d have 10 years of experience as a programmer right now. Do I want to look back in another 10 years and feel that way again? Or do I want to push through this time so in 10 years I’ll actually have the experience under my belt!?”

Easy answer!

Stick with it. Be patient with yourself if things get too complicated or you “feel too dumb” to get it. If you hit a block, go back a few pages and go through it again. Everyone is selling “learn ____ quick!” books these days. It’s a good way to get random chunks of knowledge but a terrible way to master it. So be patient!

And get this book. :). It makes things very simple to understand and really holds your hand through everything.","Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2019",Great inner content! Not that great outer quality. Still worth it!,4.0 out of 5 stars,,341,
R37T2H59DR3WSL,Zerono,"Wanted to add in a few tips, so beginners don't get discouraged. Just started reading this book yesterday, and immediately I ran into an issue with getting Sublime Text to work properly. If you're having the same problem, here's what's going wrong. On page 9, the author mentions that you can skip the part that says to create a ""New Build System"" if Python 3 is running correctly. If you were like me and you did not skip that part, then you might run into some issues. When you get to ""print(""Hello Python world!"")"" and go into Tools/Build System, choose ""Python,"" DO NOT choose ""Python3."" By creating a ""Python3.sublime-build"" you are creating an extra, and unnecessary, choice under ""Build System."" Also, the program will not run if you choose ""Python3"" that you've created. So skip the part that says to create ""Python3.sublime-build.""

When the author says to create a folder called ""python_work,"" you can create that folder anywhere, but you should actually create it on your Desktop because he later references it on the Desktop. Any file saved as "".py"" is similar to files saved as .docx, .xlsl, or .txt, so don't worry about messing things up or crashing your program; it's just another file. You can move that folder and file around, and it will still work, just like any other Word file.

Also, when you see "">>>"" it means that you need to run in terminal session. Go back and read page 4 or 6. Or click on the main Python 3.10 (64-bit) application, to go directly to Python terminal window.

Lastly, remember that this book was written in 2018-2019, so the author is using Python 3.7.2. We are currently on 3.10.2. Certain things may look and function a bit differently, but the program language and concept will remain the same.

R3G7MCXLOZGDTO,Some Guy,"This is probably one of the best introductory programming books I've ever tried. Back when I was an undergraduate, I learned Pascal (yup, they still taught it at that point), C, and C++. Neither the professors or the textbooks were very good at explaining...well...anything. Luckily, I was able to figure things out for myself, but it really left a sour taste in my mouth about programming (I've done scripting professionally, but it wasn't my primary role).

Fast forward to now. I have one foot in each of 2 worlds - behavioral science and IT (networking and security). Both worlds use Python. I decided to get this book and finally sit down and learn it (I was briefly introduced to Python when I was an undergraduate and asked why we didn't have a class in it, I would have preferred it). This book has very clear, concrete examples and you learn by doing. For the first half (or a little more), you'll learn the basics of what you need to navigate the language. You'll do short exercises to lock in what you learn. Later on the book, you'll actually work on larger, more involved projects and the author guides you through with excellent explanations.

Needless to say, I picked up Python faster than any language before it. I've come to really like the No Starch Press books as I find them (in general) to be well-written and clear.","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2021",Great,5.0 out of 5 stars,,3,
R2M2AT6AHNOA5V,geekandglitter,"I am a beginner/intermediate Python programmer with many holes in my knowledge; thus I am using this book both for reference and for systematic self-teaching.

I've never seen such a thorough, comprehensive, and easy to use table of contents and index in any technical book. This makes the book as easy to use as a reference as it is a teaching tool through building projects.

This author, who is a trained teacher, clearly has a rationale behind laying out every concept. It's no wonder it's been translated into several languages and is a best seller.

The form factor, typeface, and spacing are also carefully planned, as each page draws the eye in.

Another note of interest is that I, perhaps like many people, tend not to want to learn through building someone else's projects. I just want to learn what I need to build my own! Thus when I take online courses, I avoid those that are project based. But a physical book can make it worthwhile to build the projects, because doing so makes it an even better reference afterward. That is, the projects become old friends rather than throw-away. I only thought of this now, looking at this book, because I am confident that if any teacher/author can make me build their project, this author can.

As programmers, we all heavily use google to find answers. I am happy to now have a physical book at my side. And just to make this book even better, it comes with lots of free meta materials which the author is actively maintaining.

R32IHODPYQN8CD,N8,"I've had some programming experience in the past. I've written very basic Perl and Python programs in the past, and have a solid understanding of the basics, such as strings, variables, functions, statements, etc.

I got the book ""Learning Python"" and started going through it and was entirely lost; the book mostly focuses on using Python Interpreter for most of the examples, which made it confusing for me to follow along.

This book, Python Crash Course is one of the best books I've ever worked with in learning to program anything. The author explains everything in a very detailed, yet simplistic way, and even puts numbers next to the areas he's explaining, so that the reader can understand what area of the code is being explained.

In addition, the book has numerous exercises to do at the end of each chapter that really give the reader a clear grasp of the subject matter that has been presented. Most of the time, I tend to skip over these, because they seem so tedious and boring in other books....not so in this book. The author tells you to go find a famous quote you like, and then use that to create an exercise where you're manipulating strings (as an example).

I'd have to say that so far, this is one of the best books I've ever worked with in regards to learning programming. If you're new to programming, and don't know what a variable is verses a string, this is a great book to start with. If you're like myself, and have a basic understanding of programming syntax, but have some places that are still confusing (maybe you know how to get something to work, but not know why it works for example), this is also a great book.

Most of it is filled with explanations and vanilla examples that just is not very enlightening.
It's first chapter ""getting started"" will make you never start.

Reading the first chapter, I decided not to read any further. Then my friend came along and did all that was intended in the chapter in less than a minute. The book spends a whole chapter on what can be done in a minute. I'm sure it meant well, but it is excessively full of explanations that are not relevant, and stuff that will just make the beginners crap.

(Do beginners really have to know anything about Python 2? Or the difference between Python 2 and 3? Seriously? If not, why did you put it on the very first chapter?)

It just doesn't get any better in the later chapters.

This is a passage from Chapter 2:
""When an error occurs in your program, the Python interpreter does its
best to help you figure out where the problem is. The interpreter provides
a traceback when a program cannot run successfully. A traceback is a record
of where the interpreter ran into trouble when trying to execute your code.
Here’s an example of the traceback that Python provides after you’ve accidentally
misspelled a variable’s name ... ""

So far, it's clear that this is set up for absolute beginners, and I wouldn't call it a ""crash"" course. It's extremely thorough about walking you through common syntax errors you'll probably make on your own. I do like that it encourages you to play with breaking the code, which is absolutely necessary for learning how to code, but it's a little hand-holdy. I was expecting the guidance to loosen up as you went on, but as of chapter 6 out of the 11 chapters that introduce the topics, it's still very sheltered.

I'd suggest people wanting a little more challenge/for things to stick a little longer read the first ""A Simple ___"" section whenever a topic is introduced, then jump to the exercises. See what you can accomplish there just from seeing the example code, and if you run into trouble, then go back through all of the ""how to do this exact thing"" stuff.

Using the book this way, it's been a great reference book, and a quick read. I wish more complex ideas were introduced earlier, like conditionals/loops, so that the exercises could introduce more problem-solving than you can get with just print earlier, but I'm looking forward to the projects section.

The only issue was that I tried to cram both the main content and one of the extra projects at the end all into one semester, which was too much.
There are a couple chapters that cover more than one topic that really should be broken up into individual weeks.
We're still going to use the book, but do it over an entire year, and use some supplemental No Starch Press Python books to fill the extra weeks.
NOTE: The one area that this book doesn't cover is creating GUI interfaces. So we will use other sources for that at the end of this book in the future.

It covers more things than I originally anticipated. It's one of the few books(6) I originally purchased when getting into the Python Language. It also remains my favorite in starting out. For some reason a lot of ""beginner's"" books about SQL, C++, Python Ect seem to either assume you somehow already know how to code or project the feeling your 4yrs old. This book is NOT that. It's a prefect balance imo and even though I now have moved on, I still find myself referring back to it every once in a while. Starts out with how to install, how to code, make your own game within Python more.

They were all good, HFP being the best of the group. But this book, in my opinion, is perfect. This is a lifelong programmer taking you through a perfectly logical learning course, laying a foundation from which to build upon. Just go through it slowly and methodically, type everything in the book along the way and ponder it, and I have no doubt you will learn this language and use it capably.

The other thing I love is that he never goes more than a few pages without pausing for exercises, and the exercises are never too difficult. It's exactly what was just discussed, and the solutions are on his website if you need them (I rarely did bc of how well the material was presented).

Because my new role can really make use of learning a programming language, I thought what the hell. I bought this book expecting it to be collecting dust by chapter 2. I was wrong. I have covered 1.5 chapters each week for the last 7 weeks. It is quite evident that the author is a teacher because he understands that well thought out examples make a difference. No Algebraic expressions here…just really fun, real world examples to work on. I have confidently went from zero to hero.

The online course did a great job of helping me understand the core concepts of Python, but left out a lot of the conventions (such as formatting). This is where the book REALLY comes in handy. The author puts an emphasis on common formatting used within the industry.

The examples and the exercises are extremely well thought out and really helped me understand the code. The examples are usually something you'd encounter in real-life and when the author expands the code for those examples its done so bit by bit so you get a full understanding of what is actually going on.

First half of the book is all about learning python. The second half walks you through big projects, such as a video game, web page, or web application. I've done all the exercises and am currently working on the video game project.

Honestly, have spent thousands of dollars in books and classes related to computer science, and this book and the Head First books are all money well spent! This course actually formed together many of the concepts which I spent years learning in classrooms with a far greater understanding. Also prayer helps as well.

Ch 9 (Classes) didn't stick the first time through, but maybe it's the material ?? I expect to have to repeat it several times.

There is a BIG step up into chapter 12 -- the first large project -- Alien Invasion. Found myself in a position of typing in the code, and understanding the code, but knowing I could not write the code. What makes it especially difficult was -- to save space -- the author plugged snippets of code into partial program listings while telling you in the text to delete sections of code. I would suggest that's a very poor way of changing the code as it's extremely easy for the user to mess up. I got frustrated to the point of just quitting several times working through this portion of the book. This cost it a star.

Also, the code ran extremely slow -- taking half an hour to load. Not sure what that's about. Looked online but couldn't find anybody with a similar problem.

RDP4G6JLACZYG,Taylor,"my only complaint is, since this is an introductory book, it should give resources or cover common install issues such as placing things in the path. this is needed at the beginning of the book, and without prior programming/systems experience, this could be a huge complication. being in path may or may not be the default, depending on your system and download specifications. however this book still deserves a five star rating because it is very straight forward, building skills and competency from the ground up. i also really liked that there was a git and github section included because version control platforms can be confusing at first, but with a straight forward explanation, not hard to get used to.","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2020",Great introductory,5.0 out of 5 stars,,0,
R2PB18GJ3UZ2FJ,Mr magic,"I like how the first part of the books explains the fundamentals of programming in python and that you can apply these fundamentals in other languages. My issue with learning part 1 of the book is that I had to keep looking up other explanations on google for methods and some of the concepts. He did not really help the reader understand python syntax. So better explanation in part 1.

I just started part 2, I’m making the alien invasion game and he is not explaining it very well. im having a hard time understanding some of pygames methods and function, the author is not explaining them very efficient . So I’m going to have to read the pygame documentation to get a better understanding! i feel like the author did put much effort into the last part of the book. so im going to move on to another book to practice python!
Overall ig it’s pretty good he definitely needs some improvement. Part one is what I really like ! Idk about part 2 becuase he is not explaining the code very well.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2021",Good for programming fundamentals!,3.0 out of 5 stars,,0,

I'm super excited to have a book on python finally. I've heard the hype for this language throughout the web and educational circle for a while now, and now I finally learn it myself.

When I got the book, I thought it would be a flimsy 200 or so page read. Not this. Boasting 507 pages, I know when I'm done, I'll have something to show for.

R17D6VX0MH3SZY,Dear MR.J,"What is good about it? It teaches you the basics of Python But it does not have any advanced materials inside. Evey little example is well explained. It has a lot of examples are presented. It also asked readers to do exercises after concept.
However, I wish it comes with an answer for those after chapter exercises. Otherwise, it becomes meaningless because you won't know if you got it or not. Overall, well explained but somewhat too much explanation. Thus, this might be good for people who do not have any programming skill. Also, words are simple and straightforward.

Update: Thanks to the author reply, there are solutions online. But I still think it explained things too much. Thus, costed too much reading for a simple concept.","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2019",Good for beginner but does not go too far or deep,4.0 out of 5 stars,,109,

You don’t need any programming experience, and you don’t need a computer that’s preloaded with Python or a coding environment. All you need is fingers, eyeballs and a computer with Windows, MacOS or Linux. This book starts you from nothing, but if you go through every lesson, every exercise, every project and pay attention to the author’s advice, you’re going to come out a fairly decent software developer, capable of landing an entry-level software position. It’s fun too.

𝘗𝘺𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘯 𝘊𝘳𝘢𝘴𝘩 𝘊𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘴𝘦 starts you from nothing and walks you through the fundamentals of the Python language and popular modules. Then it ramps you up to building significant projects with step-by-step instructions. I had fun working my way through the project to develop a Space Invaders-like game. I haven’t written a game since I was a teenager. This book goes way beyond teaching you the Python programming language though. It coaches you through the many facets every software developer should know but might not know if you’re brand new to this stuff:

● Python installation to your computer (Windows, MacOS or Linux)
● Sublime Text editor installation for coding (I used MS Visual Studio Code instead.)
● Using Git for project version control
● Running programs from a terminal
● Commenting your code
● Styling your code
● Object oriented programming
● Using pip to download and install Python packages
● Importing and building modules
● Creating and using a Class
● Inheritance
● Decorators
● Exception handling
● Working with JSON and CSV data formats
● Using a web API
● Refactoring your code
● Testing your code with Unit Tests and Test Cases
● Planning a large software project and writing a spec
● Creating a game with Pygame
● Data visualization with Matplotlib and Plotly
● Writing web applications with Django
● Styling your web app with Bootstrap
● Creating and using a database with your web app
● User accounts and authentication in web apps
● Deploying your web app to Heroku so anyone on the internet can use it
● Writing secure code for use online
● Virtual environments
● How to think like a software developer
● Troubleshooting and debugging your code
● Getting help online through forums like StackOverflow when you’re stuck
● Text editors and IDEs

And this is just the second edition. I noticed the third edition of 𝘗𝘺𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘯 𝘊𝘳𝘢𝘴𝘩 𝘊𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘴𝘦 is coming out in January 2023 with updated code, practices and projects. If you want to learn about Python, or if you’re interested in learning to program from nothing, I highly recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2022",One of the Best,5.0 out of 5 stars,,0,

R38STMMJD5G6H8,Ryan,"The bad first; I had to get a replacement book. NOT because of shipping issues, because the back cover was smaller than the pages. The pages overlapped the back cover and the pages were getting hit on every surface I sat the book on. The replacement came in and it's beat up as well, which could have been shipping. At least the pages are fine. Since that's not the content I can't take away stars for a quality assurance issue.

The good; the book starts out as if you have no prior programming experience. Intermediate programmers this may not be the primer you're seeking. It's very high level, no real granularity to get you in the ground programming.

The odd; the author pushes the use of Sublime Text and then bounces from terminal to editor. The editor isn't an issue, but it's not free, it just contains an untimed trial. A license is $99(that's USD) which isn't worth it for a hobbyist. I'm not going to push off an editor or IDE, but there are dare I say better alternatives.

The WTH; I had seen reviews talking about politics 🙄 the two hyperlinks given at the beginning of the book are the authors github and the publishers website. Can't we grow up, if someone has a different view than you does that change the content? We can have different opinions and still like each other. The content is fine.

TL;DR: be careful book may arrive damaged. The content is great for the ABSOLUTE BEGINNER. I have yet to see the political views that some people are leaving poor reviews for.","Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2022",Easy to Follow,5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717dNZ8kljL.jpg

R1OD5S71G06SSB,Dan Hanson,"Edition 2 is cleaned up and better organized and focuses on Python 3 only (no reason to learn Python 2 anymore.) While it uses Python to teach you to code it also teaches clean programming skills that apply to most other languages.
The book is neatly broken down into two parts. The first half focuses on installing and using the Python language. It teaches using data, whiles, ifs, loops, accepting user input for interactivity – all the basic programming stuff.

The second part features three projects: a video game (like Space Invaders), data visualization techniques to make graphs and charts, and an interactive web application.
The book lists other online resources and has a well thought out Table of Contents and Index. Appendix A covers installation issues and troubleshooting on various platforms. Appendix B covers Text Editors including more on the recommended Sublime Text editor and Integrated Development Environments (IDE). Appendix C gives resources and ideas to take your coding beyond the book. The final Appendix shows how to use Git for version control in your programming.

R1UE6WOP54V09P,Erik T.,"This book came recommended in several searches on ""Best Python Book for EXPERIENCED programmers"". Simply put, while this book appears quite well written for complete novices who have never programmed in another language before, it's absolutely not suitable for experienced programmers who seek to learn Python.

I came expecting the first chapter to give me some clarity on the pros and cons of Anaconda vs. direct install of Python, which libraries were most essential, and advice on which of the several Python IDEs might best suit my circumstances. Instead I found a long section introducing the concept of what a text editor is, and an entire chapter introducing the concept of what a variable is.

I gave it 4 stars because the problem was with the advice I received, not with the author, who seems to have done an excellent job of writing a book for people with zero programming experience. For anyone else who shares my objectives, further research revealed that FLUENT PYTHON is probably the best book for those who have prior programming experience in other languages.","Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2019",Absolutely NOT SUITABLE for experienced programmers!,4.0 out of 5 stars,,0,

R1QPGRS3BXWGXZ,Bilal A. Hasan,"The contents are organized into two parts: Part one goes through the language constructs, functions, classes, etc.; while part two walks one through three very different projects. If you're already familiar with object oriented programming and want to learn a new language, python in this case, then you may find this book somewhat verbose. But that just means you can skim over some or more of the text per your level of familiarity. I decided to spend some time on the last of the three projects, Web Applications: This one uses the Django framework, which is great in that you can make a professional looking site fairly easily; but it is also a bit distracting in that there's less about the python language in this project and more about the Django framework constructs. Anyhow, that's likely a subjective view.

R11TLA3H995SM7,Hollow Ground,"I've been doing some work with Python, but wanted to make sure I fully understand the basics and things one can do with Python aside from data analysis.

I recommend this book for people who have never used Python before, as this book covers basics such as lists, dictionaries, if statemens, loops etc.

What I particularly like is how the code is broken down each time and the author is good at explaining what it does.

Some may find parts irrelevant to what they want to do with Python, as this book takes many examples from computer games and online services. Also, from my experience, there won't be any literature out there where you will find everything working first time. Some code from this book had me troubling a little, but much less than most sources.

You won't be a master of Python after this book, but you will have solid basics.

The reason I gave 4 stars is because the binding or glueing of this book is terrible and the bookshell broke off after a few days, as other people have mentioned here.

The pace is incredibly slow, like it was written for little children. The exercises are a joke - they don't make you *think*, they are very simplistic.

The thing that is most annoying is that every chapter he writes something like ""You will use lists when you, for example, want to write a game where you shoot aliens and want to remove aliens that were shot down"" when it is clear that you won't get anywhere near that level of programming ability by reading this useless book.

I think it's popular because it gives people a false sense that they understand the material, but all it does is set you up for failure when you try and do something that is slightly different from one of the examples in the book. As an example of what I mean, the book spends pages talking about how to create a list of favorite pizza toppings (something that should really take a couple of lines of explanation), and then there is an exercise to create a list of your favorite places in the world. Now if you know no Python, and I say this is a list of pizza toppings in Python, I would argue that you could probably give me a list of favorite cities in Python without ever having the slightest idea of what a Python list is. Pepperoni....let's replace that with Denver.........Meatballs.....you're now New York.
